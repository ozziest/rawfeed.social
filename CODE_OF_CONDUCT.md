# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Rawfeed exists to reclaim communication freedom. This community exists to build that platform together.

We pledge to make participation in this project a respectful, constructive experience for everyone—regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

- Accept constructive feedback.

**Respect for Others**

## Our Responsibilities

### Project Maintainers

We are responsible for:

- Clarifying standards of acceptable behavior
- Taking appropriate and fair corrective action
- Removing, editing, or rejecting contributions that violate this Code
- Temporarily or permanently banning contributors for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

### Community Members

You are responsible for:

- Reading and following this Code of Conduct
- Reporting violations you witness
- Supporting a healthy community culture
- Helping newcomers understand our standards

## Scope

This Code applies to:

- All project spaces (GitHub, discussions, issues, pull requests)
- Public spaces when representing the project
- Private communications if they affect the project community

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **For minor issues**: Address it directly if you feel comfortable
2. **For serious issues**: Email i.ozguradem@gmail.com
3. **For ongoing issues**: Document incidents and report them

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Consequences

Violations may result in:

**First Offense (minor)**

- Private warning
- Public clarification of what was inappropriate

**Second Offense or First Serious Offense**

- Permanent ban from all project spaces
- Public statement explaining the ban

We reserve the right to skip steps for severe violations.

### Appeals

You may appeal enforcement decisions by:

- Emailing i.ozguradem@gmail.com within 14 days
- Providing your perspective on what happened
- Explaining why the decision was incorrect

Appeals will be reviewed by multiple maintainers when possible.

## Special Considerations

### Open Disagreement is Welcome

This project challenges corporate control of communication. We expect passionate disagreement about:

- Platform features and design
- Governance models
- Moderation approaches
- Technical architecture

**Disagreement is not harassment.** Challenge ideas vigorously. Just don't attack people.

### We're Building an Alternative

Traditional social media optimizes for engagement through outrage and conflict. We're building something different.

Bring that same energy here:

- Assume good faith
- Focus on building, not tearing down
- Collaborate, don't compete

### Transparency

Enforcement actions will be documented publicly (with privacy considerations for reporters) to ensure:

- Accountability of maintainers
- Clarity of standards
- Trust in the process

## Governance

This Code of Conduct may be amended by:

- Proposal in GitHub Discussions
- Community feedback period
- Maintainer decision based on consensus

As the project grows, we'll develop more democratic governance structures.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from:

- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1
- [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/)
- Django Code of Conduct

Modified to reflect Rawfeed's specific values and mission.

**Remember**: We're building something that respects users. That starts with respecting each other.
